## üìí Notebooks

1. **1_data_understanding.ipynb**  
   ‚Ä¢ Load raw `.txt` data, inspect schema, dtypes, and missingness  
   ‚Ä¢ Compute descriptive statistics for `TotalPremium`, `TotalClaims`, `CustomValueEstimate`  
   ‚Ä¢ Calculate **overall portfolio loss ratio**

2. **2_data_cleaning.ipynb**  
   ‚Ä¢ Drop ultra-sparse columns (>99% missing)  
   ‚Ä¢ Impute binary flags, numeric and categorical fields  
   ‚Ä¢ Winsorize `TotalPremium` and positive `TotalClaims`  
   ‚Ä¢ Final missing-value checks and export `claims_clean.csv`

3. **3_exploratory_analysis.ipynb**  
   ‚Ä¢ **Loss Ratio** by Province, VehicleType, and Gender (bar charts)  
   ‚Ä¢ Histograms & boxplots for financial variables to spot outliers  
   ‚Ä¢ Temporal trends in claim frequency & severity (time-series)  
   ‚Ä¢ Top/bottom 10 vehicle makes/models by average claim amount

4. **4_hypothesis_testing.ipynb**  
   ‚Ä¢ œá¬≤ tests for claim frequency across Provinces & PostalCodes (p < 0.001)  
   ‚Ä¢ ANOVA for margin differences by PostalCode (p < 0.001)  
   ‚Ä¢ Z-test for gender differences (p ‚âà 0.84)  
   ‚Ä¢ Effect sizes (Cram√©r‚Äôs V, Œ∑¬≤, Cohen‚Äôs h) and Bonferroni-corrected pairwise comparisons

5. **5_predictive_modeling.ipynb**  
   ‚Ä¢ **Regression**: predict claim severity (`TotalClaims > 0`) with Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost  
   ‚Ä¢ **Classification**: predict claim probability (`has_claim`) with Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost  
   ‚Ä¢ Evaluation metrics: RMSE & R¬≤ for regression; accuracy, precision, recall, F1 for classification  
   ‚Ä¢ **SHAP**-based feature importance for best models  
   ‚Ä¢ Compute **risk-based premium** = P(claim) √ó E[claim] and compare to current premiums

## üèÜ Key Results

- **Overall Loss Ratio:** calculated in Notebook 1 (see cell output)
- **Geographic Variation:**
  - Claim frequency differs significantly by province (œá¬≤ ‚âà 110.7, p < 0.001; Cram√©r‚Äôs V ‚âà 0.01)
  - Postal‚Äêcode level shows even stronger differences (œá¬≤ ‚âà 1 451.7, Œ∑¬≤ ‚âà 0.002)
- **Gender Analysis:** no significant difference in claim frequency (Z ‚âà ‚Äì0.2, p ‚âà 0.84; Cohen‚Äôs h ‚âà 0.002)
- **Data Distributions:** heavy right‚Äêtail in `TotalClaims`, many zeros in `CustomValueEstimate` (handled via winsorization)
- **Temporal Trends:** claim frequency and severity exhibit seasonal/long-term patterns over the 18-month period
- **Top Risk Vehicles:** identified makes/models with highest average claims for targeted underwriting
- **Predictive Models:**
  - **Best severity regressor**: _e.g._ XGBoost with RMSE ‚âà X and R¬≤ ‚âà Y
  - **Best claim classifier**: _e.g._ Random Forest with F1 ‚âà Z
- **SHAP Insights:** top drivers include vehicle age, cubic capacity, registration year, and location features
- **Risk-Based Premiums:** model-estimated premiums highlight segments where current pricing over- or under-charges
